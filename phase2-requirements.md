# Project Phase 2 – Cloud Dashboard Development

## 1. Phase Overview

In Phase 1, you developed and tested an Azure Function locally using Azure Functions Core Tools. That function performed data analysis on the 'Diets Dataset' by reading raw data from Azurite (local blob storage), performing data cleaning, and generating visualizations (charts). 

Now, in Phase 2, you will move your solution to the Azure Cloud and build a web-based dashboard that displays the visual insights generated by your Azure Function. This phase focuses on cloud deployment, frontend integration, and cloud service interaction.

## 2. Learning Objectives

- Deploy serverless functions to Azure Functions App in the cloud
- Store and retrieve datasets from Azure Blob Storage hosted in the cloud
- Create a dashboard web application to visualize data using charts
- Connect your frontend dashboard to the backend Azure Function endpoint
- Demonstrate understanding of cloud-native architecture — using Azure services instead of local emulators

## 3. Phase 1 → Phase 2 Connection

| Component | Phase 1 (Local) | Phase 2 (Cloud) |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Function Execution** | Localhost using Azure Core Tools | Azure Functions deployed to Azure portal |
| **Blob Storage** | Azurite (local emulator) | Azure Blob Storage account |
| **Dataset Access** | Local blob container | Public/secured blob container in Azure |
| **Output** | Local console/logs and files | Dashboard UI in browser |
| **Goal** | Build and test functionality | Deploy, visualize, and interact in the cloud |

## 4. Cloud Setup Instructions

1. Create/Use Azure Subscription and Resource Group (e.g., `diet-analysis-rg`)
2. Provision Azure Function App, Azure Storage Account, and Static Web App/App Service
3. Deploy the Azure Function
4. Update storage connection strings to point to live Azure Blob Storage
5. Test Azure Function endpoint using Postman or browser
6. Develop dashboard UI and fetch data from Azure Function endpoint

---

## 5. Dashboard Requirements

- Display at least three data visualizations generated from the Azure Function (e.g., bar chart, line chart, pie chart)
- Include interaction controls such as dataset filters or refresh buttons
- Show metadata such as function execution time
- Be deployed and publicly accessible via Azure Static Web App or App Service

## 6. Rubrics for Phase 2

| Category | Description | Marks |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Deployment (Azure Cloud)** | Successfully deployed Azure Function and Storage in Azure environment | 20 |
| **Frontend Dashboard** | Functional and visually clear dashboard UI | 20 |
| **Data Visualization** | At least three distinct and meaningful visualizations | 20 |
| **Integration** | Frontend correctly fetches and displays data from Azure Function | 20 |
| **Cloud Practices** | Proper use of Azure resources (resource group, environment variables, storage connection) | 10 |
| **Documentation & Presentation** | Clear explanation of architecture, workflow, and challenges | 10 |
